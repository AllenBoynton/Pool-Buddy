As a sand filter collects dirt, its efficiency increases, trapping more dirt. When your pressure gauge shows a reading 8 - 10 lbs. over the clean, start-up reading, it is time to backwash the captured dirt out of the filter. \nSand filters are known to be the lowest maintenance of the three types of pool filters. You may only need to open up the tank every 5 years or so. DE filters require removing the internal grid assembly at least annually to clean them well, and cartridge filters don't backwash, you remove the cartridge and hose clean every so often, depending on the cartridge filter size. Sand filters are the easiest to operate and maintain.\n\"They say\" that the sand inside a sand filter should be replaced after seven years. Gradual loss of efficiency may be hard to notice. If your sand filter requires frequent backwashing, every week or two, the sand bed may be \"mudballed\", or it may be \"channeled\". It may also \"calcify\" with calcium deposits. Other water balance problems may also contribute to pool filter sand deterioration, but a properly sized sand filter could go over 10 years between sand changes."))

The cartridge is removed from the tank and hosed thoroughly, top to bottom, with a high pressure hose to remove dirt when the pressure gauge rises 8 - 10 lbs. above its clean reading. I know some people that take their cartridges to the local self serve car wash place for cleaning, but too much pressure may damage the cartridge. Each time the cartridge filter element is cleaned, some of its filtering ability is reduced.\nThe cartridge should be replaced every 3 - 5 yrs, depending on the work it was asked to do. If the filter was a bit undersized, and had some algae every year and lots of tree debris, etc. then it may last only 1 - 2 years. Nicely sized cartridge filters can operate for 6 months between cleanings and get more than 5 yrs from the cartridges."))

If you have a suction side pool cleaner, it will also remove water and debris from your pool via a dedicated suction line through your pool cleaner. The water then moves through your heating device where it heats water before it enters your pool.

As the pump circulates the pool's water, the water drawn from the pool passes through a filter and then to the heater. The gas burns in the heater's combustion chamber, generating heat that transfers to the water that's returned to the pool.\nThey're most efficient when heating pools for short periods of time, and they're ideal for quickly heating pools. Therefore, gas pool heaters can be a good choice for pools that aren't used on a regular basis. Unlike heat pump and solar pool heaters, gas pool heaters can maintain any desired temperature regardless of the weather or climate.\n\nHeat Pumps: Heat pumps use electricity to capture heat and move it from one place to another. They don't generate heat.\nAs the pool pump circulates the swimming pool's water, the water drawn from the pool passes through a filter and the heat pump heater. The heat pump heater has a fan that draws in the outside air and directs it over the evaporator coil. Liquid refrigerant within the evaporator coil absorbs the heat from the outside air and becomes a gas. The warm gas in the coil then passes through the compressor. The compressor increases the heat, creating a very hot gas that then passes through the condenser. The condenser transfers the heat from the hot gas to the cooler pool water circulating through the heater. The heated water then returns to the pool. The hot gas, as it flows through the condenser coil, returns to liquid form and back to the evaporator, where the whole process begins again."))

Most pools have efficiency in sanitizing, filtering and circulation such that they don't need to operate 24 hours a day. Pools are designed to \"turnover\" the water in the pool in eight hours time. We commonly set time clocks to operate 10 - 14 hours per day, depending on the efficiency of the system, the ambient air temperature, amount of sunlight and debris and the usage the pool receives.\nI commonly advise pool owners to operate the filter system during the day, so that processes are active while the sun is beating down and the pool is most likely to be in use. This would be something like 9 a.m. - 9 p.m. You may realize lower electrical consumption if you didn't operate between 12 p.m. - 6 p.m.... peak sunlight hours.... You decide.\nSetting a time clock is simple. Inside the box you'll see a 24 hour dial. There are two \"timer dogs\" on the dial. One turns the timer switch on, allowing power to go to the filter pump, and the other turns the switch off, stopping power from going past the timer to the filter pump. Loosening the small screw on the timer dog allows you to slide the dog to any time on the dial. Reposition and retighten."))

Chlorine generators are attractive to pool owners simply because they eliminate the need to store, buy, transport and handle chlorine. They are not an alternative to chlorine, but actually make their own chlorine from regular table salt. The pool water passes through a generator cell that creates the chlorine within the pool water.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nAs pool water passes through the chlorine generator cell, pumped through by your filter pump, the salt in the water is turned into Hypochlorous acid. Hypochlorous acid is the exact same component that is produced when any chlorine is added to pool water, whether you use sticks, tablets, granular or liquid. As the water returns to the pool, it will introduce the newly produced chlorine, preventing algae, bacteria and killing micro-organisms, creating a safe and sanitary swimming environment.\n\nOK?  How does it really work?\n\nThis mild, pleasant saline water is sanitized through the process of electrolysis, as mentioned above. The electrolytic cell, through the use of a small electric current, breaks down the water into its basic elements, Hydrogen and Oxygen. By adding small quantities of granulated salt (much like household table salt - NaCI), Hypochlorous Acid (common chlorine) is produced. During the process, the Hypochlorous Acid (Chlorine) is ultimately converted back to salt. Thus, the salt does not get \"used up\". Salt only needs to be \"topped off\" once or twice a year and only to replace salt lost due to water splash-out, bather drag off or filter backwashing.\n\nSalt in My Pool?\n\nThe salt level required to maintain a safe, chlorinated pool is about 2500 to 4000 PPM (parts per million). The human body cannot taste salt until the PPM is around 5000. As a reference point, the ocean is around 40000 ppm. The amount of salt in the pool is usually not noticeable. Once the salt is added to the pool, there is no need to add salt on a yearly basis unless the pool is drained or a significant amount of water is removed. Also, the salt level is low enough so there is no danger of equipment corrosion. Chlorine generator users also report the water is softer, leaving a more refreshed feeling after swimming."))

When a pool smells strongly of Chlorine, what smells is not free available chlorine, but Chloramines . When testing for Free and Total Chlorine with a DPD or other capable pool test kit, the level of combined chlorine molecules in your pool can be detected. The formula is quite simple. The difference between Free Chlorine reading and the Total Chlorine reading is the Combined Chlorine reading. Anything over 0.3ppm should be treated to bring the level down by removing the Chloramines from the pool.\n\nChloramines can be removed from the water by the following three methods:\n\n\t1. By adding a mega-dose of chlorine. Usually 3 to 6 times more chlorine than a normal dose is added to the water, or the level of chlorine is raised to 5 to 10 ppm and held there for 4 hours. This is called super-chlorination. To remove chloramines, the ratio of chlorine to ammonia must be at least 7.6 to 1. If this ratio is not obtained, then more chloramines will be produced. A threshold of \"breakpoint chlorination\" must be reached where total oxidation takes place. This \"shock\" to the pool will rip apart the molecular combinations, and destroy chloramines. Swimmers and bathers should not enter the water until the level of chlorine has dropped to 3 ppm or less.\n\n\t2. By adding a non-chlorine shock to the water. The most common chemical used for this is potassium peroxymonosulfate. This \"shocking\" requires the addition of one pound of shock for each 10,000 gallons of pool water. The same threshold of breakpoint oxidation must be reached when using non-chlorine shock. So, feel free to add a little extra, just to be sure.\n\n\t3. By adding ozone to the water. If an ozone generator is installed on a pool or spa, then oxidation of the ammonia and nitrogen compounds will take place whenever the ozone system is operating. The longer the system operates, the more the ozone can destroy the ammonia and nitrogen. Although most ozone systems operate only when the pool or spa pump is operating, there are 24 -hour systems available which will continuously oxidize ammonia and nitrogen as they enter the water.\n\nRemember, when you smell a strong chlorine odor in a pool - and your eyes are red, it's not because there is too much [free] chlorine in the water, but too much Combined Chlorine. Free chlorine by itself does not smell, nor sting the eyes. The solution to this is to add a whole lot more chlorine, to reach breakpoint chlorination, where the molecular combination of chlorine and nitrogen [or ammonia] will be removed.

Below 7.0 and a substance is defined as being acidic, while levels above 7 are said to be basic or alkaline. Everything that enters your pool has a pH value. Ever heard of acid rain? This is rainfall with a very low pH. The human eye at a pH value of 7.35, is just slightly basic. This is, coincidentally, in range with proper pH levels for your pool. To have pH in balance we adjust the water with additions of pH increasers (bases) or pH de-creasers (acids) to achieve the range of 7.2 - 7.8.\n\nIf your testing (recommended daily) of the water shows a pH value below 7.0 the water is in a corrosive (acidic) condition and you will need to add a base to bring the pH into a more basic range to prevent corrosion. It doesn't take too long for a low pH condition to weaken vinyl, strip heat exchangers and pit plaster. Conversely, if the pH is above 7.8, we are in a scaling (basic) condition and must add an acid to bring down the pH to prevent the formation of scale or calcium deposits on our tile, in the filter, or even precipitation out of solution into a cloudy water condition."))

Most people believe that if their eyes are burning while swimming in a pool, then it is due to the chlorine in the pool. In reality, there are two more common reasons that can cause eye irritation when swimming in a pool.\n\nThe first reason for eye discomfort is due to the pH of the water in the swimming pool. The acceptable ranges for pH falls within 7.2 to 7.8 range. These ranges are important for several reasons. When the water is within this pH range, then the water is in balance and it has a less detrimental impact on the pool and the pool equipment. Most importantly, when the pH is within this range and balanced it is more comfortable for the swimmer’s eyes. The reason for this is because the pH of the human eye is 7.4. Therefore whenever the pH range is either low (more acidic water) or high (more basic water) then this typically causes discomfort to the human eye. This principle is similar to balancing the pH in baby shampoos to protect the baby’s eyes during bathing.\n\nThe second reason for eye discomfort is due to the lack of chlorine. Combined chlorine is what happens when chlorine is being locked up by organic waste and is rendered useless in the swimming pool. When this happens, chloramines are  produced, which has a distinct odor similar to the smell of chlorine. These chloramines also cause eye irritation. The next  step to eliminate this problem is by simply adding more chlorine to the water. The goal is to reach breakpoint chlorination by adding the necessary dosage of  chlorine to eliminate the combined chlorine in the water, so that the free chlorine can effectively do its job and sanitize the water properly. Of course, when the  chlorine levels are too high, this can cause “bleaching” of swimsuits and skin, as well as eye irritation."))

Also known as the buffering capacity of the water, alkalinity keeps the pH from \"bouncing\" all over the place. Low alkalinity is raised by the addition of a base (similar to pH); sodium bicarbonate is commonly used. High levels of alkalinity are lowered by the addition of an acid (similar to pH).\n\nWe recommend \"pooling\" the acid in a small area of low current for a greater effect on alkalinity.  That is, adding an acid underwater, in a deep end corner will create a greater hydrocarbon exchange and have a greater effect on lowering TA in your pool. Acids will lower both pH and alkalinity, but walking the acid around the pool in a highly distributed manner is said to have a greater effect lowering the pH than the alkalinity. Pooling the acid has the opposite effect. Some manufacturers notably United Chemicals, have created acids specifically designed to lower Alkalinity strongly, while having little effect on pH.\n\nA very important component of water balance, alkalinity should be maintained in the 80-120ppm range for \"gunite\" and concrete pools and 125-170ppm for painted, vinyl, and fiberglass pools.

The test for Calcium Hardness is a measure of how \"hard\" or \"soft\" the water is. \"Hard\" water can have high levels of calcium and magnesium. If these levels are too high, the water becomes saturated and will throw off excess particles out of solution which then seeks to deposit themselves on almost any surface inside the pool. They can be attracted to ladders, lights and in extreme cases deposit themselves as very small crystalline clumps - all over the pool surfaces.

Sold commercially as \"Pool Conditioner\" or \"Pool Stabilizer\", cyanuric acid sales amount to millions of metric tons per year for swimming pools and water treatment facilities.\n\nCyanuric Acid, or CYA as it is sometimes called, also saves millions of dollars in chlorine cost for pool operators and pool owners, who add it directly to the pool water, in a granular, flake or liquid form. Once added to the pool water, it seeks out and bonds to Free Chlorine molecules, reducing their activity, and thereby reducing the ability of UV rays to destroy the molecule.\n\nCyanuric acid is also used by pool chlorine manufacturers to create chlorinated cyanurates. Sodium Dichlor pool shock is a stabilized form of granular chlorine, a compound formed of sodium salts. Trichlor tablets are produced by further chlorinating the Dichlor into Trichlor compounds, and pressing them into a tablet. These pre-stabilized chlorinated cyanurate products contain a small amount of cyanuric acid, which is added to the pool as the chlorine is released.\n\nWhat is the Best Level for pool stabilizer?\n\nSwimming pool operators should maintain a level of 10-20 ppm on a shady pool and 20-40 ppm on a sunny pool.

It can be automatically fed by the pool with an erosion feeder (See Chlorinators in the Equipment Category), another is by a floating chlorinator (which dispenses even when the pool filter and pump are not on) and to add by hand...with safety goggles and gloves of course.\n\nBacteria and algae are unwanted guests at any pool party. Your continuous chlorine level should always fall between 1 and 4 ppm for proper sanitation and to prevent bacteria and algae. There are a variety of options available to help you keep your pool clean.\n\n\u{2022} Basic Chlorinating Tabs - Slow-dissolving chlorinating tablets, found in both 1-inch and 3-inch sizes, keep your water clear. Most chlorinating tablets have a built-in stabilizer to protect your chlorine from sunlight burn-off. Chlorinating tablets can be used in your floating dispenser, skimmer or automatic chlorinator.\n\n\u{2022} Liquid Chlorine - Liquid chlorine is similar to the bleach you use in your household, but is two to three times stronger when formulated for pools. Liquid chlorine is easy to apply and an effective sanitizer, but it has a short shelf life compared to other chlorine products. It can't be stored for more than a few weeks.\n\n\u{2022} Chlorinating Tabs - Many varieties of chlorine sanitizers offer a multifunctional approach to pool care. There are a variety of chlorinating tabs available to sanitize your pool and keep it in great shape for swimming, while shocking your pool to remove contaminants. Other varieties kill bacteria and control algae, while softening your water and protect pool equipment.\n\n\u{2022} Chlorinating Granules - Multifunctional granular chlorine products can help you perform several tasks at once by chlorinating, shocking and killing algae with a single, daily application."))

It can get rid of contaminants that cause cloudy water, chlorine odor and eye irritation, while also preventing future problems and reducing the need for other chemicals. There are a variety of shock products for use in any pool.\n\n\u{2022} Basic Shock Products - Basic shock products help kill bacteria and break down cosmetics, suntan lotions, perspiration and other swimmer wastes that can't be filtered out of pool water. Shocking with basic shock products reduces chlorine odor and eye irritation, and it helps to keep your pool sparkling clear.\n\n\u{2022} Multifunctional Shock Products - Multifunctional shock products quickly restore water clarity by effectively destroying bacteria and swimmer wastes, while also balancing pH, enhancing filtration and adding additional algae protection. Many shock products get you back in the pool extra-fast, as soon as 15 minutes after treatment. This is done with a non-chlorine oxidizer called, Potassium Monopersulfate (Also known as the brand name we use, Fresh N Clear). It is listed in our Chemicals Category to learn more about it."))

Leave it unchecked and your water will quickly become unusable due to clogged filters, low water circulation and reduced effectiveness of pool chemicals. Algaecides prevent algae from taking over the pool, and they treat algae growth if gets started.\n\nLooking for fast results? Some algaecides quickly kill all types of algae and prevent them from returning. Other algaecides focus specifically on preventing and removing green algae, which is the most common kind found in a pool. Prevention is the key to an algae-free pool. In the case of an algae outbreak, algaecides can quickly and efficiently eliminate the problem and restore your pool to sparkling clear.\n\nThere are a number of types of Algaecides or Algaestats made. They are all made to kill or prevent the algae a number of different ways.\n\nAlgaecides and Algaestats:\n\n1. Quaternary Ammonium Compounds:\nA low grade type of algaecide, Quats, as they are called, will usually have \"10\" somewhere on the bottle, representing 10% active ingredient. Although available at a lower cost, quats tend to produce a small amount of surface foaming. They are most effective as an algaestat, that is, as a prevention, not a cure.\n\n2. Polymers:\nPolymers are long, complicated chemical chains that behave in water both as an algaestat and an algaecide. They are available in percentage strength of 30 - 60%, are non foaming, and work well as general, all around algae treatments. Poly-Quats are a blended compound of polymer and quats.\n\n3. Copper Based:\nCopper is a proven algaecide and algaestat. Available in varying non foaming strength of 3 - 10%. It works very well on all types of algae, but it has the drawback of staining white plaster surfaces a light blue/green color if it precipitates out of solution. Most copper based algaecides are chelated, which means that agents have been added to prevent this, such as Lo-Chlor Algaecide.\n\n4. Silver Based:\nSilver has been shown to be an effective bacteriostat, which means that it works to prevent bacteria from reproducing. Non foaming and effective with pink algae. In high doses, reactions with sunlight can cause colloidal silver to deposit as black stains on white plaster. When using copper or silver algaecides, the use of a sequestering agent is recommended.\n\n5. Chlorine Enhancers:\nThese are not algaecides, but work to provide a synergistic boost to hypochlorites when added separately, but at the same time. Sold under trade names like Mustard Buster, Yellow-Out or Yellow Treat, it is most effective on, you guessed it, yellow algae. Since it is not an algaecide, the makers are not required to tell what it is made of, but we do know that it works quite well, in conjunction with a little brushing and vacuuming on your part."))

The pressure gauge will tell you when it’s time to clean your filter. When the gauge reads 8 to 10 pounds per square inch over the normal starting pressure, your filter should be clean.\n\nYour Air Relief Valve is used to let air and water out of the filter tank simply by turning the valve in one direction both water and air will pass through the opening.\n\nThe function of the grids is to hold the DE. They act as a screen to capture dirt, debris and other particles. The amount of grids, shape and style vary by Manufacturer.\n\nThe manifold collects all the water after it passes through the grids. It sits directly atop the grids and holds them together in the filter.\n\nYou should clean your DE filter at least once every month or whenever you’re pounds per square inch is 8 to 10 pounds above the normal starting pressure. Cleaning your DE Filter involves three basic steps: Backwashing, Cleaning the manifold and grid and adding new DE.\n\nThe first step in cleaning your DE is to backwash. Backwashing will clear out all the dirt and debris inside your DE Filter. Place the filter valve in the backwash position, then start your pool pump. When the water coming out of your discharge hose is clear, shut off the pump and return the valve to its normal position.\n\nAfter Backwashing make sure your pump is off then open the air relief valve and remove the drain plug allowing the water out of the filter tank to drain. Now open the DE filter by releasing the clamp around the tank or undoing the bolts. This will depend on the model of your DE filter. After you have opened the tank remove the manifold and take out each grid. Using a garden hose flush out all of the DE from the filter grids. Then use the hose to rinse the rest of the tank.\n\nAfter cleaning the DE off the grids place them back in the manifold inside the filter. When you have cleaned and put back the grids you need to lubricate the ring on the inside of the tank.\n\nNow we’re ready to add DE back into the filter. Start by priming your pool pump. Remove the strainer basket lid and fill the basket with water allowing some water to run through the incoming line. Lubricate the O-Ring or gasket in the pump lid with Pool & Spa lube then replace the lid and tighten any other clamps or bolts on the pump.\n\nRelease all-excess air from the tank by turning the Air relief valve. Now turn on the pool pump. Close the air relief valve when the water begins to come out. Make sure your pump is running before you begin adding DE. Calculating how much DE you are going to need for your filter involves a simple calculation.\n\nYour DE Filter is either 24, 36, 48 or 60 square feet. That size should be noted on your filter or in your filter’s instruction manual. Now, take the square footage of your filter and divide by 5, that number equals how many scoops of DE you should add.\n\nMix the required amount of DE together with enough water to make a thin creamy mixture. With your pump running, pour the mixture directly into the pool skimmer. The DE will be drawn to the filter and distributed evenly over the grids.\n\nAfter adding DE, you’re done cleaning your DE filter. Allow your pump to run 30 minutes before turning it off. When cleaning your DE filter remember these 3 simple steps.\n\n1. Backwash your filter\n2. Clean the manifold and DE grids\n3. Add new DE to your filter.\n\nFiber Clear is a safe and effective alternative to DE. It filters better than DE and gives your water a polished look and feel. And unlike DE, Fiber Clear is environmentally friendly, non-toxic and biodegradable."))
        
        products.append(PoolData(label: "Cartridge Filter Cleaning", image: "cleancartridge2", label2: "", image2: "", description: "One advantage of having a cartridge filter is the lack of continuous maintenance it requires. Unlike a sand filter that needs to be backwashed multiple times per month, a cartridge filter only needs to be cleaned a few times per year. Ideally, if you clean your filter at least four times per year, the life of the cartridge elements will be extended.\n\nWhen a cartridge filter needs to be cleaned, it can be a tedious process. The steps are simple, but it can take a lot of time to clean it properly.\n\nThe following steps show you not only how to clean your cartridge filter, but how to clean it efficiently.\n\n1.Shut the system off. This should be the case when working with any type of pool equipment.\n\n2.First things first. You’ll want to bleed the air slowly from the filter by turning the air relief valve, typically on the top of your filter. Next, remove the clamp that holds your filter together. Different brands may have different mechanisms, but either way, it needs to be removed. Documentation that comes with your filter will teach you how to properly remove it.\n\n3.Once the clamp is removed, carefully take off the top section of your cartridge filter to expose the cartridge elements inside.\n\n4.There may be some part holding these cartridges in place, but the specific build will vary by brand and model. If this is present, it needs to be removed before taking your cartridge elements out. Again, if you are unsure how to remove this, refer to the product documentation.\n\n5.Carefully take out the cartridge elements and set them aside. Check each cartridge for potential damage that may have been caused. If there are any cracks in the plastic housing or tears in the pleats, it is strongly recommended to replace the filter cartridge. Even a small tear can decrease the effectiveness of the filter.\n\n6.Use a degreaser like Spray and Rinse Filter Cleaner. Thoroughly coat the cartridge elements, making sure you also get the product in between the pleats. This product can simply be sprayed onto the cartridge. Follow product instructions for how long to keep this product on the elements before rinsing it off. Other products such as Cartridge Cleaner require you to soak your elements overnight instead of spraying the product on them.\n\n7.Products like the Filter Flosser can be used as an attachment to a garden hose to effectively rinse in between the pleats on the cartridge element. This is where most dirt and debris is found, so it is important to clean this area. A simple garden hose can also be used, using your thumb to increase water pressure.\n\n8.Once all of your cartridge elements are clean, securely replace all elements and parts in the proper place.\n\n9.Check the O-ring that is in place on the filter tank. If it appears dry-rotted or too flat, it may need to be replaced. Bring the O-ring into a local Leslie’s store to check. If your O-ring is in good shape, a light layer of silicone-based lubricant should be used to coat the O-ring.\n\n10.Securely replace the tank lid and tightly close the clamp that holds it together.\n\n11.Double-check that everything is properly closed and in place before turning on your system to ensure everything is running properly.\n\n12.Once your system is running, open up the air relief valve at the top of your filter tank to release any excess air in the system. Leave this open until water consistently sprays out of the valve.\n\n13.Once the air is out of your system, take note of the filter pressure using the gauge on top of the filter (measured in pounds per square inch [PSI]) to make sure it is in the proper range. If the PSI seems off, something may have been put back together incorrectly or there may be another problem with the system.\n14.Shut off the system."))
        
        products.append(PoolData(label: "Sand Filter Cleaning", image: "sandfiltercleaning", label2: "", image2: "", description: "Of the three types of filters, a sand filter is the easiest to clean on a routine basis. Instead of manually cleaning the system like you do with a cartridge filter, you use water from your pool to rinse all the dirt and debris out of the filter. That water is then discharged through your backwash hose to an area of your choice. This can be your grass or another area of your yard. Avoid backwashing into the street or other drainage area. Often, your city will have regulations preventing this. If you do not want to backwash into your yard, you can call your city and they can provide information where it is acceptable to backwash to.\n\n“How often should I backwash?” is a typical question asked by 90% of pool owners. A good rule of thumb is to backwash once the pressure displayed on your pressure gauge is 8-10 psi over the starting level. Also, backwashing after cleaning up from a large storm, killing an algae bloom, or when trying to treat cloudy water will keep your filter working effectively.\n\nBackwashing your sand filter is a very easy process. All sand filters use the same concept to backwash, but many have setups that vary due to a different manufacturer or model. The following steps will take you through how to backwash your Sand Filter.\n\n1.Shut the system off. This should be the case when working with any type of pool equipment.\n\n2.Unwind your backwash hose, making sure it is tightly clamped to the water outlet.\n\n3.Once the hose is laid down, return to your equipment and find your backwash valve. Most systems have a “Push-Pull” handle. When the handle is in either position, the water will either flow normally through your equipment or flow out of your backwash hose. Labels on your backwash valve will typically have information on which position your valve needs to be in for backwashing. If there are no stickers, look in product documentation or take a picture of the setup and show a local pool professional.\n\nNote – Some systems have multi-port valves instead of “push-pull” valves. Instructions on how to set the valve up for backwashing can either be found on the valve itself or in product documentation.\n\n4.With the system still off, move the backwash valve handle into the backwashing position and lock the handle in place.\n\n5.With the handle locked in the backwash position, turn on your system. You should begin to quickly see water flowing through the backwash hose.\n\n6.Continue backwashing for around 3 minutes or until the water appears clear. When looking at the water flowing out of the hose, you may notice it looking dirty. This is the dirt and debris being removed from the sand in the filter.\n\n7.Turn off the system to stop backwashing.\n\n8.Roll up the hose, removing excess water that is left from backwashing.\n\n9.Return the backwash valve handle to its normal position that allows water to flow through your system and lock it in place.\n\n10.Turn the system on and open up the air relief valve at the top of your filter. Leave this open until water is consistently being released, then close the valve.\n\n11.Shut off the system.\nProducts such as a Sand Filter Revitalizer can be used in conjunction with backwashing in order to remove caked-on oils and organic materials that are left over after backwashing. Refer to the product instructions for application directions."))
